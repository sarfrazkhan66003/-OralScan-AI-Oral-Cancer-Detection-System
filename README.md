# -OralScan-AI-Oral-Cancer-Detection-System

🚀 OralScan AI is a deep learning–powered system that helps in the early detection of oral cancer using image analysis.
It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (Grad-CAM) to not only predict if an image shows cancer but also highlight the exact suspicious regions using heatmaps.

✨ Introduction
Oral cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
Early detection = Higher survival rate ✅.

This project uses deep learning models to classify oral images into:
  -Cancerous 🟥
  -Non-Cancerous 🟩
It also provides heatmaps 🔥 to visually explain where cancerous regions are located in the oral cavity.

🛠️ System Architecture
Frontend: Simple web interface / Colab interface to upload images.
Backend: Python + TensorFlow/Keras models.

Models:
-Model 1 (VGG16-based) – high accuracy, large-scale training.
-Model 2 (Lightweight CNN) – fast, optimized for real-time screening.

XAI Integration: Grad-CAM heatmaps for interpretability.
Output: Single PNG image containing prediction + heatmap.

🧠 Algorithms & Key Concepts
Deep Learning CNNs:
 -VGG16 (Transfer Learning): fine-tuned on oral cancer dataset.
-Custom CNN: lightweight and fast for edge devices.

Data Augmentation:
-Patch Shuffle 🧩 – random shuffle to improve generalization.
-CutMix ✂️ – mixes images for robust learning.

Explainable AI (XAI):
-Grad-CAM highlights regions responsible for prediction.
-Overlayed heatmap helps doctors see why the model decided “cancer”.
